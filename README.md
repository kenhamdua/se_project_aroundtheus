**Intro**

This project 3 (Sprint 3) "Around The U.S." use responsive design and shows how the project should look at different screen dimensions. With the interactive page the user could add and remove photos. We also learn some ways to work with the Figma web site.

Tools Used:
Visual studio code - This is used to program the features.
Dev tools - This is used to trouble shoot and debug.
Figma - Used to have the idea what to look forward to, program layout.

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
