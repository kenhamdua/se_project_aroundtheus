**Intro**

This project "Around The U.S." use responsive design and shows how the project should look at different screen dimensions. With the interactive page the user could add and remove photos. We also learn some ways to work with the Figma web site.

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
